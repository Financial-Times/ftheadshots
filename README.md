## Usage

You want to use these headshots, please read the documentation over at the [headshot-images repository](https://github.com/Financial-Times/headshot-images)


## Adding or modifying headshots

To keep head-shots consistent, please follow these guidelines:

- Head-shots must be in PNG format
- Head-shots must be cut out against a transparent background
- Head-shots must be square
- Head-shots must be colour
- Head-shots should have some blank space at the top of the shot
- Head-shots should be mostly of the face, cropped above the shoulder. See [the registry](http://registry.origami.ft.com/components/headshot-images) for examples of this
- Head-shots should be as high quality as possible (the Image Service will resize them for the appropriate use case)
- Head-shots must be named as the person they represent. Filenames must be all lower-case hyphenated.
